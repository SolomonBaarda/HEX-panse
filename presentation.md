### Game Mechanics
Turn based strategy game hexagonal grid for movement 

Players can move up to two tiles per turn, and only to tiles of a similar height (same, or +- 1 height)

If there is a player or a base on an adjacent tile, then the player can attack it using dice roll mechanics

If a player dies then they will respawn at a random base that they own

If the player captures the base, then they own it and will recieve reinforcement health every three turns

### Planned Mechanics
Online multiplayer (would require some extra features, timed rounds, party/lobby/invite system, voice chat/text chat, game servers needed etc)

Players should be able to customise their mechs to allow for different play styles

Spend their initial health as "skill points", to invest in better abilities, or could play as a tank if not doing that
* Melee or ranged attack, attack strength, attack range, area of attack etc
* Number of tiles to move each turn

Add additional win conditions - like the secret challenges in Risk, its unlikely that there will ever be one person that wins the game as it takes way too long, stalemates etc

Graphical changes - revamp models, add more models for trees, rocks etc, add textures, different lighting for each map, lava bloom and particle effect, animations for player moving and attacking etc

### Feedback Implemented
Wanted more feedback for the user, was confusing what was happening in the game:
* Added a move preview and attack highlights (green and red)
* Added health +- text when fightinhg so clear who is taking damage
* Changed "strength" to "health" as is was confusing why value was decreasing during fights

Small graphical changes:
* Added more idle animation - smoke from the chimneys and flames when mechs are moving
* Made the lava material emit light
