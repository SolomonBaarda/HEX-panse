## Core concept
Turn based strategy game that works as both a board game and video game. Uses a hexagonal grid for movement and a low-poly, isometric graphical style. 

Features a randomly generated game board and dice roll mechanics. 2-6 players must fight it out for control of the island.

## Game Mechanics
* Players start at their own base, with a certain strength
* Can move up to 3 tiles per turn
* Enemies spawn around the board at the start
* To capture an enemy base, player must move onto that tile
* Fight difficulty is determined by the difference in strength of the two tiles, if it's a large difference then fight will be quick
* Each turn, player gains certain number of strength for each base controlled, so it is beneficial to capture other bases
* Last player alive wins

## Inspiration 
Civilization, Catan and Polytopia.
